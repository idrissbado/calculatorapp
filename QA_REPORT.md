## Linting Issues

The ESLint configuration enforced the following rules:
- No unused variables
- Consistent use of single quotes
- Semicolons required
- No console logs in production code

### Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Inconsistent Quote Usage**
   - Found: Mixed usage of single and double quotes throughout the codebase
   - Fixed: Standardized to single quotes as per ESLint configuration

2. **Missing Semicolons**
   - Found: Several statements missing semicolons
   - Fixed: Added semicolons to all statements

3. **Unused Variables**
   - Found: Several declared variables that were never used
   - Fixed: Removed unused variables or implemented them properly

4. **Console.log Statements**
   - Found: Debug console.log statements left in production code
   - Fixed: Removed all console.log statements

## Code Reviews

### Pull Request #1: Add Scientific Calculator Functions

**Reviewer:** Jane Smith

**Feedback:**
- The square root function should throw an error for negative numbers
- Variable names could be more descriptive
- Missing tests for edge cases
- Good implementation of the square function

**Actions Taken:**
- Added error handling for negative inputs in square root function
- Renamed variables for clarity
- Added tests for edge cases including negative inputs
- Merged after addressing all feedback

### Pull Request #2: UI Enhancements

**Reviewer:** John Doe

**Feedback:**
- Button hover states need more contrast
- History panel should have a scrollbar for many entries
- Theme toggle button needs a more descriptive label
- Excellent responsive design implementation

**Actions Taken:**
- Increased contrast on button hover states
- Added scrollbar styling for history panel
- Changed theme toggle button to include text "Change Theme"
- Merged after addressing all feedback

### Pull Request #3: Theme Switching Feature

**Reviewer:** Alex Johnson

**Feedback:**
- Theme colors should be defined in a central location
- Need to ensure text remains readable in all themes
- Consider adding a dark mode option
- Good use of CSS variables

**Actions Taken:**
- Refactored theme colors into a getThemeColors function
- Adjusted text colors to ensure readability
- Added task to backlog for dark mode implementation
- Merged after addressing critical feedback

## CI Pipeline Results

### Successful Build
![Successful CI Build](https://placeholder.svg?height=200&width=400)

The CI pipeline successfully runs on every push and pull request. A typical successful build completes the following steps:
1. Checkout code
2. Set up Node.js environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Run linting checks
5. Execute all tests
6. Build the application

### Failed Build Example
![Failed CI Build](https://placeholder.svg?height=200&width=400)

During development, we intentionally broke the build to test the CI pipeline. The most common failures were:
1. Failing tests due to logic errors
2. Linting errors from not following code style guidelines
3. Build errors from syntax mistakes

The CI pipeline effectively caught these issues before they were merged into the main branch.

## Summary

The QA practices implemented in this project significantly improved code quality and reliability. Unit tests ensured that all calculator functions worked correctly, including edge cases. Linting enforced consistent code style and prevented common errors. Code reviews facilitated knowledge sharing and caught issues that automated tools missed.

The CI pipeline tied everything together by automatically running tests and linting on every code change, providing immediate feedback to developers. This comprehensive approach to quality assurance resulted in a more robust, maintainable application with fewer bugs.
